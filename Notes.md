Chapter 2
- You can 
put all of your application files 
into a Java ARchive—a .jar file—
that’s based on the pkzip format. 
In the jar file, you can include 
a simple text file formatted as 
something called a manifest, that 
defines which class in that jar 
holds the main() method that 
should run.

Chapter 3
- Variables come in 2 types: 8 primitives (BCBSILFD) and references
- Object Reference is like a remote control pointed to the actual object in the heap
- Null just means a remote control that isn't controlling/programmed to anything. It is a reference, not actual object

Chapter 4
- Encapsulation: 1. You could validate the setted value in the setter 2. You could easily change code around the instance variables without changing others' codes
- You do not need to initialize the instance variables, it will have DEFAULT values. In contrast, local variables will not have DEFAULT values.
- use "==" to compare if references are the same or primitive types, but always use equals if you want to compare the object values (useful at work)
